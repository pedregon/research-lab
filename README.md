# About

Site currently under construction.

## Purpose

The purpose of this blog series is to act as not only a safe place for me to release my own findings and knowledge but to also serve as an open-source resource for others. Within this blog, I intend to post my own research and walkthrough the common/uncommon concepts relating to cyber security. As the consumer, you can expect the following topics to be included within this series of blog posts:

* Malware development
* Red team tools and infrastructure
* Operating systems security \(Windows, Linux, and MacOS\)
* Low-level programming
* Reverse engineering
* Network programming
* Machine learning and data analysis

However, most of the tools, tactics, and procedures \(TTPs\) that will be discussed were orginally discovered by other security researchers or may be referenced elsewhere online. I do not claim credit or ownership for any of these occurrences and try my best to reference sources accordingly. My goal in re-posting or utilizing existing TTPs is to further upon the existing repositories of information by logging my own journey and contributing new paradigms to the conversation. If I have missed citing something, please reach out to me on any of the provided points of contact listed.
